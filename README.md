  This program organizes files in a directory by file type. It automatically:
  1. Creates folders based on file extensions (e.g., .jpg, .pdf, .mp3).
  2. Moves files into their respective folders, helping keep your directory clean and organized.
     
  It's a simple and efficient way to declutter folders like Downloads, Desktop, or any location with mixed file types.
  Currently, it can only organize **txt, jpeg, jpg, png, and pdf** files.

  How to use:
  1. Place the executable file to the directory you want to organize.
  2. Run the file.
